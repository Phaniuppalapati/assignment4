    "\n",
    "append(element): This method is used to add an element to the end of a list. It takes a single argument, which is the element to be added, and appends it to the end of the list. The original list is modified, and the element is placed at the last index position.\n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_list)  \n",
    "Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "insert(index, element): This method is used to insert an element at a specific index position within a list. It takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the element and the element itself. The original list is modified, and the existing elements are shifted to accommodate the new element.\n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.insert(1, 4)\n",

    "\n",
    " Q 11)There are several methods  for removing items from a list in but two commonly used methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "remove(element): This method is used to remove the first occurrence of a specific element from the list. It takes a single argument, which is the element to be removed. If the element is found in the list, it is removed, and the list is modified. If the element is not present, a Value Error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]\n",
    "my_list.remove(2)\n",
    "print(my_list)  \n",
    " Output: [1, 3, 2]\n",
    " \n",
    "pop(index): This method is used to remove an element at a specific index position from the list. It takes an optional argument, which is the index of the element to be removed. If the index is not provided, it removes and returns the last element of the list. The list is modified, and the removed element can be stored in a variable if needed. \n",
    "\n",

    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "removed_element = my_list.pop(1)\n",

    "Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    " Q 12).List values and string values share some similarities, but they are fundamentally different data types in most programming languages. However, I can highlight a few similarities between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequences of elements: Both lists and strings are sequences of elements. In a list, the elements can be of any data type, while in a string, the elements are individual characters. Both can be accessed using indexing and slicing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterability: Both lists and strings can be iterated over using loops or other iterative constructs. This allows you to access each element or character within them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Length: Both lists and strings have a length that represents the number of elements or characters they contain. You can obtain the length of a list using the `len()` function, and for a string, the `len()` function returns the number of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and slicing: Lists and strings support indexing and slicing operations to access specific elements or characters. You can use square brackets (`[]`) with an index to retrieve a particular element or character. Slicing allows you to extract a portion of the sequence by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 13) tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items, but they have some key differences. Here are the main differences between tuples and lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability: Tuples are immutable, which means their elements cannot be changed once they are defined. In contrast, lists are mutable, so you can add, remove, or modify elements after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses () or without any delimiters, separating elements with commas. For example, (1, 2, 3) or 1, 2, 3. On the other hand, lists are defined using square brackets [], enclosing elements with commas. For example, [1, 2, 3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations: Since tuples are immutable, they support a limited set of operations such as indexing (accessing elements by position) and slicing (extracting sub-tuples). Lists, being mutable, support additional operations like appending, extending, and removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: Tuples are often used to represent collections of related but different types of data. For instance, a tuple (name, age) can represent a person's name and age. They are also used when you want to ensure the integrity of data, as their immutability prevents accidental modifications. Lists, being mutable, are typically used when you need to store a collection of similar items and may need to modify or reorganize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "person = ('Alice', 25)\n",
    "print(person[0])  \n",
    "Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    " Q 14)To type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42\n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "my_tuple = (42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 15)convert a list value to its tuple form  you can use the tuple() function. \n",
    "\n",
    "code:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 16)Variables that \"contain\" list values in programming languages typically hold references or pointers to the actual list objects, rather than the lists themselves. The variables store the memory address or location of the list objects in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign a list to a variable, the variable holds a reference to the memory location where the list is stored. This allows you to access and manipulate the list by using the variable\n",

    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Q17)The copy.copy() function performs a shallow copy of an object. It creates a new object and copies the references of the original object's attributes to the new object. If the attributes are mutable objects, any changes made to the attributes in the copied object will also affect the original object and vice versa. However, if the attributes are immutable objects like numbers or strings, changes made to the attributes in one object will not affect the other.\n",
